# pythonVM
Working on this with a friend.
This is a Python project (python 3, duh), that aims to simulate the basic processes of a CPU, with a basic instruction set that should be Turing-complete.
Example programs and documentation can be found in `main.c`.
This happens to be my first experience with Python since the days of VoltOS and my crappy socket-based message-sending system.
Other than the horrible whitespace/indentation system, Python isn't too bad!

# Instruction Set
- NOP
- HLT
- LDA
- ADD
- SUB
- OUT
- JMP
- JEZ (Jump if Equal to zero)
- JNZ (Jump if Not equal to Zero)
